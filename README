Development
-----------

mvn clean                # Clean the working copy.
mvn install -DskipTests  # Quick compile, no tests.
mvn -Prelease            # Release mode (javadocs, sources, zip/tgz bundles, gpg signing).
                         # Results in: target/*.tgz

Release
-------

mvn -Prelease clean deploy  # Snapshot or release deploy to sonatype [requires proper setup in settings.xml]


MySQL Testing
--------------------------
The MySQL unit test runs an embedded instance of MySQL, listening on a random
port.  However, the test is disabled under the default build profile, and is
only executed when the `tests-include-mysql` profile is active.  This is done
for two reasons:

 1. Running an embedded instance of mysql as part of a maven build requires
    `mysql-connector-mxj-db-files`, which is around 133MB in size.  By moving
    the test to a different profile, we are able to skip downloading this (very
    large) dependency, unless the user explicitly specifies that he wants to use
    it.
 2. Running an automated task which opens up a random port can cause problems
    with firewalls or other applications, and opening up a port introduces
    potential security problems.  The port is not opened under the default build
    profile.
